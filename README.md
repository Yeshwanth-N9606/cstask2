# Phishing Email analysis
cyber security task 2- phishing email analyze
## 🔍 Phishing Analysis
#### 1.Sample obtained ✅
* ✔️ This is a safe, educational phishing simulation from CanIPhish.
#### 2.Sender’s email spoofing
* 📧 adobesign@alerting-services[.]com
* ⚠️ This is not an official Adobe domain. Adobe would use something like @adobe.com.
#### 3.Email headers (not shown)
* 🚫 Headers aren’t visible in this image, but you’d check them using an email header analyzer.
#### 4.Suspicious links or attachments
* 🔗 “Review and sign” button — likely links to a malicious or fake site (common phishing trick).
* ✅ Hover over it to inspect the actual URL (not shown in image).
#### 5.Urgent or threatening language
* 📣 "Your signature is required" creates a sense of urgency — a phishing hallmark.
#### 6.Mismatched URLs
* ❓ Not visible in the image, but phishing emails often disguise malicious links under legitimate-looking text.
#### 7.Spelling/Grammar errors
* ✅ None are visible here — not all phishing emails have errors, but it’s still a trait to look for.
